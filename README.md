# Responsive Web Design


## In this Repositorie I create a page responsive for 3 queries: Mobile , Tablet and Desktop.

### 1. Change the colour
*Mobile: the background color of Body is **red** when the width of the viewport is smaller than 300px
*Tablet:  green when the viewport width is bigger than 300px and smaller than 768px 
*Desktop:  blue when the viewport is bigger than 768px.

### 2. Display / hide elements
Add three `div`: one div with the id="small", one div with the id="medium", another div with the id="large". In each element add the word small, medium and large to its content for display purposes.

Only one DIV is displayed, according to the width of the current viewport.

### 3. Adapt the size of the text according to the device
In each DIV, add a title and a few paragraphs (lorem ipsum, and such). Give the title a descriptive text (for example: "Content for smartphones")
Change the font size according to the device type.

### 4. Re-Arrange
- if small, the 3 divs are stacked on top of one and other.
- if medium, the first div takes 2/3 of width, the second 1/3 of width and the third the full width.
- if big, the 3 divs should be next to one and other.
